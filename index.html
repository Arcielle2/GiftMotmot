            <strong>Hi Baby,</strong>
            <p>
              Hi babe, I just want to say sorry for the things I've done these past few days and even before. I'm so sorry I didn't take your words well. I'm sorry that I realized too late how much those words meant to you.  
              I really appreciate how you manage to make things between us happy and enjoyable, and how you ensure we bond with each other.  
              I know I've done wrong, but please forgive me. Sorry, babe, for hurting you. I care about your feelings, and I'm sorry if I'm too stubborn.  
              Also, I'm sorry for the things I've said. I like you for who you are. I love you, even when you're being masungit, and I appreciate you not tolerating my stubbornness.  
              Sorry for saying those things even when it was my fault.  
              Please accept my peace offering, baby ðŸ¥º. I know it's just sweets, but my real gift is still on the way.  
              I know you don't want more stuff because you already have everything, but I still want to give you something because I truly appreciate you.  
              Please forgive me, babe. I'm sorry, Timothy. I love you so much ðŸ¥º. Mwaa.
            </p>
